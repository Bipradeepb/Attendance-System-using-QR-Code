# Attendance-System-using-QR-Code
In this project I have created an attendance system based on Qr codes. The attendance of the students which will be marked on scanning the qr-codes.
Languages used: Python

##Generating QR-Codes
Qr codes will generated automatically and once within the a new directory under the current working directory.
These Qr codes may be sent to the students via whatsapp or mail.

##Marking attendance
Qr codes will be scanned and their respective attendance will be marked. A temporary daily attendance file with name, enrollment number, email, current date and time of attendance will be created in the current working directory.
Based on this temporary file a final attendance list will be daily updated and the total attendance upto that date will also be stored.
